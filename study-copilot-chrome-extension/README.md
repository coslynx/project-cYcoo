# Study Copilot Chrome Extension

## Project Description

- Develop a Study Copilot Chrome extension using React with the following features:
  - Incorporate a small image with a chat popup in the bottom right corner for text input and output, powered by GPT-4.
  - Allow users to start a Pomodoro session and specify what they want to study.
  - Ensure that during the Pomodoro session, any tab the user visits is relevant to the study target.
  - If the user visits an irrelevant website in a tab, the extension's chat popup should warn the user.

- Chat functionality for text input and output.
- Integration of GPT-4 for intelligent responses and suggestions.
- Pomodoro timer to help users stay focused during study sessions.
- Ability for users to set study targets for each Pomodoro session.
- Real-time monitoring of the tabs visited by the user.
- Popup chat notifications to alert users when visiting irrelevant websites.
- Customizable settings for study preferences and notifications.

## Potential Enhancements

- Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze user study habits and provide personalized recommendations.
- Integrate with popular productivity tools like Trello or Google Calendar for better task management.
- Include a feature to track and visualize study progress over time.
- Offer different study modes such as focus mode, relaxation mode, and brainstorming mode.
- Add a feature for users to create study notes directly within the extension.
- Improve the user interface for a more intuitive and seamless user experience.
- Allow for customization of the chat popup design and position on the screen.
